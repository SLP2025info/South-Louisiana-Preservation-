## üöÄ How It Functions

This application is built using standard web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

* **HTML (Structure):** Defines the content of the webpage, such as the header, navigation tabs, property cards, and filter sections.
* **CSS (Styling):** Controls the visual presentation, including colors, fonts, layout (like grids and flexboxes), responsiveness for different screen sizes, and animations (e.g., the floating header background and tab fade-in effects).
* **JavaScript (Interactivity):** Powers the dynamic features, such as:
    * Loading rental property data into the respective tabs.
    * Switching between "Apartments," "Houses," "Resources," and "Overview" tabs.
    * Filtering properties based on search terms, maximum rent, and number of bedrooms.
    * Managing the active state of navigation tabs.

## üéØ What to Expect

When you open the `index.html` file in a web browser, you will see a clean and responsive rental guide.

* **Header:** A prominent header with the guide's title, contact information, and a breakdown of covered zip codes for different areas.
* **Navigation Tabs:** A sticky navigation bar at the top, allowing you to easily switch between different sections of the guide.
* **Property Listings:**
    * **Apartments & Houses:** These tabs will display a grid of rental property cards. Each card includes details like name, address, rent range, bedrooms, and other specific information.
    * **Filtering:** Above the property grids, you'll find a search bar, a "Max Rent" dropdown, and a "Bedrooms" dropdown to help you narrow down the listings.
* **Resources Tab:** This section provides external links to popular rental platforms (Zillow, Apartments.com, Trulia, HotPads) and contact information for "South Louisiana Preservation" for personalized assistance. It also includes important reminders for renters.
* **Overview Tab:** Offers statistical insights into the rental market, including counts of available properties, rent ranges by property type, and an expanded description of the geographical coverage areas.
* **Responsiveness:** The layout will adapt to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop computers and mobile devices.
